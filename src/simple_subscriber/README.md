# simple_subscriber

This project is a simple subscriber which is useful to use as a template for more complex projects.

## Getting Started

The node will basically continue to search if a new message is published on the topic /number.
If there is a new message it executes the callback (the function named DataCallback).

### Prerequisites 

The package does not require any other installations.

## Running the tests

After compiling the node you have to open the terminal and type

```
roslaunch simple_subscriber subscriber.launch
```
